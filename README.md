## Help spreading Decentralized Finance

Decentralized Finance is a new field, but quickly extending its tentacles through a myriad of new and diverse ideas, projects and services.
The objective of this repository is to serve as a speaker for the community to pipe news to a common place with great visibility: the de.fi website.
People (or well educated robots) can submit their news, articles, projects or propositions related with Decentralized Finance here, and after a soft review, they will be forwarded to the de.fi website.

## The principles of de.fi
Communities are built on principles, an the ones behind de.fi are:
- **Transparency**. After a basic review, the resources submitted here through issues, will be transparently forwarded to the de.fi website. No arbitrary censorship.
- **Equal access**. Do you have a Github account? Do you have some interesting article you want to share with the Decentralized Finance community? It seems that you already fulfill the requisites.
- **Collaborative**. We are showing the world that we are powerful when we collaborate. Let's combine ideas and help pushing the ecosystem forward.

## Contribution roles
It's not possible to foresee which kind of actors are going to participate in de.fi, but initially, there will be:
- **Contributors** - anyone that creates an issue with a resource to be published in the website.
- **Curators** - recognized members of the Decentralized Finance community that will help checking the contents and generating organic and enriching discussions.

## Some basic contribution guidelines
If you want your resource to be published in de.fi, you only need to:
- **Issue creation**. Create an issue following the available [template](./template.md) in the repository. The mandatory sections are a clear title, a small overview and the content, which can be even a link to an external resource.
- **Well-written text**. We are not looking for the next Shakespeare, but before the publication, some basic grammar/expression requirements need to be fulfilled.
- **Appropriate content**. The contents of the resource need to be related with the topic of Decentralized Finance and they must not be offensive or completely out of context.
- **No promotions**. Do you want to share some news about an interesting project or breakthrough? Great, but direct promotions that don't provide any additional value to the community will not be allowed.

## Who is behind de.fi
The de.fi initiative, website and this repository is supported with :heart: by [AAVE](https://aave.com), but the goal is to gather all the Decentralized Finance participants around it, sharing, thinking and moving the field forward together
